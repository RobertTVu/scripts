# EICAR Antivirus Test

Python script to test Windows Defender using the [EICAR test file](https://www.eicar.org/).

## Usage
```bash
python eicar_test.py
```

## What it tests

This script tests three types of antivirus detection:

1. **On-Write Detection** - Blocks malicious files when they're being created/written to disk
2. **On-Access Detection** - Blocks malicious files when you try to open/read/execute them
3. **Real-time Protection** - Continuously scans and automatically removes threats in the background

Most modern antivirus software (including Windows Defender) uses all three methods as layers of protection.

## How it works

1. Creates EICAR test file in `C:\temp`
2. Waits 3 seconds for AV response
3. Attempts to read the file (triggers On-Access scan)
4. Reports results

## About EICAR

EICAR is a **safe** test string recognized by all antivirus software as malicious, but contains no actual harmful code.
